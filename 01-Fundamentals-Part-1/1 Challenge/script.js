// Coding Challenge #1
// Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is
// calculated using the formula:
// BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg
// and height in meter).
// Your tasks:
// 1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
// 2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both
// versions)
// 3. Create a Boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about
// whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.
// Test data:
// ยง Data 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95
// m tall.
// ยง Data 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and is 1.76
// m tall.
// GOOD LUCK

// Solution of Coding Challenge #1:

// 1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
// Data 1:
// const marksHeight = 1.69;
// const johnsHeight = 1.95;
// const marksWeight = 78;
// const johnsWeight = 92;
// Data 2:
const marksHeight = 1.88;
const marksWeight = 95;
const johnsHeight = 1.76;
const johnsWeight = 85;

// 2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both versions)
// BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg
// and height in meter).
const markBmi = marksWeight / marksHeight ** 2;
console.log(`Mark's BMI is = ${markBmi}`);
const johnBmi = johnsWeight / johnsHeight ** 2;
console.log(`John's BMI is = ${johnBmi}`);

// 3. Create a Boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about
// whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.
const markHigherBMI = markBmi > johnBmi;
console.log(markHigherBMI);
